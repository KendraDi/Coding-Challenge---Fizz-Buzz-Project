Built a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. The program will print "Fizz" for a number that is divisible by 3. The program will print "Buzz" for a number divisible by 5. The program will combine the two words and print "FizzBuzz" for a number that is divisible by both 3 & 5. If a number does not fit any of the above conditions, the program will print that number. Enjoyable coding challenge utilizing conditional statements.
